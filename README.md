# secondattemptbio

### Overview
This is my second attempt at creating a portfolio.  While this is far from what I want my finished product to look like, this is better than the previous one I had and fulfills the requirement of homework 9. One of the challenges I had was Bootstrap being finicky with my div containers and sizing them correctly to fit all within the inteneded white space. As far as future developments go, this page will be scrapped for something highly superior compared to this shell of a portfolio.
